# Arch :angel: Thunder :bird: 

When the everywhere-eye asks you:<br/>
“Who is the emperor of the sky?”<br/>
Take the Archangel's Thunderbird :zap:<br/>

Go to Edgar Allen<br/>
In the tower of sleep :european_castle:<br/>
He'll tell you a story<br/>
Which makes you to creep<br/>
The echo of your cries is falling so deep<br/>

Rent a destroyer and sail to Cape Cod :boat:<br/>
There lives a lion, they call him God<br/>
There is your elevator to Eden<br/>
But a hole in the sky<br/>

In shock-corridors standing<br/>
People with their eyes in their hands :raised_hands:<br/>
But they don't understand<br/>
Don’t get with your confessional<br/>
Flare into the vaulting flight of stairs<br/>

Baiting soldiers sleeping in melting house of wax<br/>
Why is the audience not taking the resurrection axe :guitar:<br/>
Thousands of windows burst open<br/>
And the alarm bells are broken :bell:<br/>
