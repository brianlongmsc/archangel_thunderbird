When the everywhere-eye asks you:
“Who is the emperor of the sky?”
Take the Archangel's Thunderbird

Go to Edgar Allen
In the tower of sleep
He'll tell you a story
Which makes you to creep
The echo of your cries is falling so deep

Rent a destroyer and sail to Cape Cod
There lives a lion, they call him God
There is your elevator to Eden
But a hole in the sky

In shock-corridors standing
People with their eyes in their hands
But they don't understand
Don’t get with your confessional
Flare into the vaulting flight of stairs

Baiting soldiers sleeping in melting house of wax
Why is the audience not taking the resurrection ax
Thousands of windows burst open
And the alarm bells are broken
